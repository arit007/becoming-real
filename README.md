Becoming Real
------------
### About the Project:

I knew I wanted to utilize 3D printing in my project from the beginning and decided to combine it with the challenge of the 8-bit track for PatriotHacks Hackathon. I enjoy futuristic settings and love sci-fi and thought that a very cool idea would be to combine the virtual world and the physical world. My project is mixed media with both the pixel art I made and a figure I 3D printed during the limited time I had. My inspiration was a desire to combine the virtual world with the physical world, so I jumped at the chance to use 3d printing artistically. 

### Made with:
← Procreate for artwork
<br>← Ultimaker Cura for preparing model (https://www.thingiverse.com/greenskies/designs)
<br>← Ender 3 Pro Printer for printing the model
<br>← LED circuit created for eyes

### Plans for the future:
← Attach a micro servo so the head can rotate
